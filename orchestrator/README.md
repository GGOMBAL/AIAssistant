- Monitor task completion and progress

### Agent Coordination
- Orchestrate complex workflows across multiple agents
- Resolve conflicts and dependencies between agents
- Implement workflow scheduling and prioritization
- Ensure data consistency across the system

### Strategic Planning
- Plan long-term system improvements and optimizations
- Analyze system performance and identify bottlenecks
- Coordinate system-wide configuration changes
