# Integration Guidelines
integration:
  calling_helper_functions:
    description: "How other agents should use helper functions"
    pattern: |
      # Correct way to use helper functions from other agents
      from Project.Helper.yfinance_helper import YFinanceHelper

      price = yf.get_current_price("AAPL")  # Read-only usage
      
      # DO NOT modify helper code from other agents
      
  error_handling:

    pattern: |
      try:
          result = helper_function()
          if result.get('success'):
              # Handle successful result
              data = result['data']
          else:
              # Handle error through proper logging
              logger.error(f"Helper function failed: {result.get('error')}")
      except Exception as e:
          logger.error(f"Error calling helper function: {e}")

# Validation Rules
validation:
  before_deployment:
    - "helper_agent must validate all helper functions"
    - "All helper tests must pass before production"
    - "API credentials must be properly configured"
    - "Cross-agent integration tests must pass"
    
  ongoing_maintenance:
    - "helper_agent responsible for helper function updates"
    - "helper_agent manages API rate limits and health monitoring"
    - "helper_agent maintains helper documentation"

# Enforcement
enforcement:
  automated_checks:
    - "Git hooks to prevent unauthorized helper file modifications"
    - "Code review requirements for helper file changes"
    - "Automated testing of helper functions on changes"
    
  manual_review:
    - "helper_agent must approve all helper-related changes"
    - "Architecture reviews for cross-agent integration changes"
    - "Security reviews for credential and API changes"

# Documentation Requirements
documentation:
  helper_agent_responsibilities:
    - "Maintain HELPER_FUNCTIONS_MANUAL.md"
    - "Document all API integrations and credentials"
    - "Provide integration examples for other agents"
    - "Maintain test documentation and coverage reports"
    
  other_agents_responsibilities:
    - "Document helper function usage in their code"
    - "Report helper function issues to helper_agent"
    - "Follow integration patterns defined by helper_agent"
