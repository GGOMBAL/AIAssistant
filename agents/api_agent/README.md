# API Agent

## Agent Information
- **Agent Name**: API Agent
- **Model**: Claude-3.5-Flash
- **Layer**: Service Layer
- **Primary Responsibility**: External API management, connectivity, and data integration

## Core Functions

### API Management
- Manage connections to external data providers
- Handle API authentication and authorization
- Monitor API rate limits and usage quotas
- Implement retry logic and error handling

### Data Integration
- Transform external data into internal formats
- Handle different data schemas and formats
- Manage data mapping and field conversions
- Ensure data quality and consistency

### Connectivity Management
- Monitor API endpoint health and status
- Handle connection failures and fallbacks
- Manage API credentials and security
- Implement caching strategies for efficiency

## Data Access Requirements

### Read Access
- `/shared/configs/api_settings/` - API configurations and credentials
- `/shared/external_apis/` - External API specifications
- `/agents/data_agent/requests/` - Data requests from Data Agent

### Write Access
- `/agents/api_agent/` - Agent logs and temporary files
- `/shared/communication/api_data/` - Retrieved data for other agents
- `/03_service_layer/api_integration/` - Integration status and metadata
- `/shared/external_data/` - Raw external data storage
